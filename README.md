# JavaScript XML HTTP Requests

JavaScript XML HTTP Requests (xhr) are provided by browsers for performing
asynchoronous network operations (a.k.a. AJAX in jQuery). In jQuery, `$.ajax`
returns something called a "deferred object" that behaves a lot like a promise.
In this training, we create our Promise interface for xhr using native promises
and native xhr.

## Prerequisites

-   Familiarity with jQuery `$.ajax`.
-   [ga-wdi-boston/node-api-promises](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/node-api-promises)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Compare Promises with jQuery Deferred objects.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Demo: XML HTTP Requests

## Lab: Compare XHR with AJAX
